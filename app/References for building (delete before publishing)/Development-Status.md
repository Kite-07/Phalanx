## ❌ Not Yet Implemented (Phase 0)

### Remaining Tasks (~5% of Phase 0)

### High Priority (Polish Items)
1. **Enhanced UI**
   - ✅ Empty states with helpful text (COMPLETED 2025-11-01)
   - ✅ Message selection actions in top bar (COMPLETED 2025-11-01)
   - ✅ Archive/pin threads (COMPLETED 2025-11-01)
   - ✅ Pinned messages within conversations (COMPLETED 2025-11-01)
   - ✅ Message actions - copy/forward/timestamp (COMPLETED 2025-11-01)
   - **⏸️ Reply to messages (DEFERRED)** - Requires Room database for proper storage
     - Reply preview above composer
     - Reply reference bubble in sent messages
     - Scroll to original message on tap
     - **Note:** Core implementation partially done (data model + UI), but storage layer blocked until Room is implemented

2. **Character Counter Intelligence** ✅ (COMPLETED 2025-11-01)
   - ✅ Show segment count for long messages (e.g., "145 (1/2)")
   - ✅ Warn when approaching limit (red text when <10 chars remaining)
   - ✅ Different limits for different encodings (GSM-7: 160/153, UCS-2: 70/67)
   - ✅ Detect GSM-7 vs Unicode encoding automatically
   - ✅ Handle GSM-7 extended characters (count as 2)

### Medium Priority
3. **Contact Features**
   - ✅ Unknown number country code detection and flag display (COMPLETED 2025-11-01)
   - Multi-recipient group messages (currently single recipient only)

4. **Settings Enhancements**
   - Notification sound/vibrate customization (currently uses system defaults)
   - Theme selection (system/light/dark)
   - Text size options

5. **UI Polish**
   - Swipe gestures (delete, archive)
   - Pull to refresh
   - Visual SIM indicator on sent message bubbles (colored border)

### Low Priority
6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Message pagination (currently loads all messages in thread)
   - Virtual scrolling for very large threads
   - Image caching strategy for contact photos
   - Background database optimization

7. **MMS Testing**
   - Full MMS send/receive testing requires real Android device with active SIM card
   - Emulator testing not possible due to APN/carrier requirements

### ❌ Not Feasible (Blocked by Platform Limitations)
10. **RCS Support** - BLOCKED
   - **Status:** Cannot be implemented by third-party apps
   - **Reason:** RCS has no public Android APIs. Google Messages uses proprietary Google Jibe infrastructure that requires Google partnership. The GSMA Universal Profile standard exists but implementation is locked to carrier/Google integrations.
   - **Alternative:** MMS provides rich media support (images, videos, audio) and is fully implementable
   - **Future:** May become possible if Google releases public RCS APIs (no known timeline)
   - What RCS would have provided:
     - Send/receive RCS messages
     - High-res images and videos
     - Read receipts and typing indicators
     - Group messaging with RCS
     - Fallback to SMS/MMS when RCS unavailable

---

- ML classifier (optional)
- Update service
- Cache hardening
- Battery optimization
- **Status:** 0%

## 🐛 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Bugs
1. **Character counter:** Doesn't account for GSM-7 vs UCS-2 encoding correctly (shows count only, not segments)
2. **Long messages:** Multi-part assembly may not preserve order on some older devices
3. **Contact photos:** Slow initial load, no caching strategy
4. **MMS on emulator:** Cannot test MMS functionality on Android emulators (requires real device with SIM)

### Technical Debt
1. **No architecture pattern:** Activities are doing too much (1000+ lines in SmsDetailActivity)
   - **Fix:** Migrate to MVVM with ViewModels and UseCases
   - **Impact:** High - harder to test and maintain as features grow
2. **No dependency injection:** Manual instantiation everywhere
   - **Fix:** Add Hilt
   - **Impact:** Medium - makes testing difficult
3. **No database:** Reading directly from ContentProvider
   - **Fix:** Add Room for local caching and threading
   - **Impact:** Medium - affects performance and offline capabilities
4. **No repository pattern:** Activities directly call ContentResolver/helpers
   - **Fix:** Add data layer with repositories
   - **Impact:** Medium - tight coupling between UI and data
5. **Basic error handling:** Some operations fail silently or show generic toasts
   - **Fix:** Proper error states and user-friendly feedback
   - **Impact:** Low - functional but not polished
6. **No testing:** Zero unit tests or integration tests
   - **Fix:** Add test coverage as per PRD requirements
   - **Impact:** High - risky for refactoring and adding Phase 1+ features

### Performance Issues
1. **Large thread loading:** Loads all messages at once, no pagination
   - **Impact:** May cause lag on threads with 1000+ messages
2. **Contact resolution:** Queries run on background thread but could be optimized
   - **Impact:** Low - works acceptably for now
3. **Repeated queries:** No in-memory caching of messages or contacts
   - **Impact:** Low - ContentProvider has its own caching
4. **Image loading:** Contact photos loaded repeatedly without caching
   - **Impact:** Low - Compose caching helps but not optimal

## 🎯 Project Goals Alignment

### Short-Term Goal (Phase 0)
Build a fully-functional SMS messaging app that can:
- ✅ Send and receive SMS reliably
- ✅ Handle MMS (send/receive with attachments)
- ✅ Display conversations with contacts
- ✅ Work with dual SIM
- ✅ Be set as default SMS app
- ✅ Provide complete notification experience (including quick reply)

**Status:** 95% complete. Core SMS/MMS functionality is done. Only polish items remain (empty states, archive/pin, copy/forward).

### Long-Term Goal (Phase 1-7)
Add privacy-first security layer on top:
- ❌ Link analysis (Phase 1)
- ❌ Risk detection (Phase 1)
- ❌ Security UI (Phase 2)
- ❌ Trash vault (Phase 3)
- ❌ All other security features

**Status:** 0% complete. Phase 0 must be finished first per PRD.

## 💡 Key Learnings & Decisions

### What Went Well
1. **Compose-first approach:** Clean, modern UI with minimal code
2. **DataStore for preferences:** Type-safe, reactive settings
3. **Multi-SIM support:** Robust implementation working well
4. **Contact integration:** Seamless name/photo resolution
5. **Search functionality:** Fast and comprehensive

### What Needs Improvement
1. **Architecture:** Need MVVM + DI for better separation
2. **Error handling:** Too many silent failures
3. **Performance:** No pagination or caching strategy
4. **Testing:** Zero test coverage currently
5. **MMS:** Should have prioritized earlier

### Design Decisions
1. **No Room database yet:** Using ContentProvider directly
   - Pro: Simpler to start
   - Con: No offline caching, harder to implement threading logic
   - Decision: Add Room after Phase 0 basics work

2. **DataStore instead of SharedPreferences:** Modern, type-safe
   - Pro: Reactive, coroutine-based
   - Con: More boilerplate
   - Decision: Worth it for maintainability

3. **Activity-based navigation:** No Navigation Component
   - Pro: Simple, straightforward
   - Con: Harder to test, more boilerplate
   - Decision: Sufficient for v1, may add later

4. **Full-screen default app gate:** No "Skip" option
   - Pro: Ensures proper functionality
   - Con: Slightly aggressive UX
   - Decision: Correct choice - app needs SMS permissions

5. Focus on completing Phase 0 before starting security features

### Priority Order
1. **Complete MMS support** (biggest gap in Phase 0)
2. **Finish notification system** (quick reply processing)
3. **Integrate drafts** (backend exists, needs UI)
4. **Add message status** (sent/delivered/failed indicators)
5. **Refactor to MVVM** (prepare for Phase 1 complexity)
6. **Add Room database** (enable better threading and caching)
7. **Start Phase 1** (security layer)
