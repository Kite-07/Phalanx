## üêõ Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Bugs
1. **Character counter:** Doesn't account for GSM-7 vs UCS-2 encoding correctly
2. **Long messages:** Multi-part assembly may not preserve order on some devices
3. **Contact photos:** Slow initial load, no caching strategy

### Technical Debt
1. **No architecture pattern:** Activities are doing too much
   - **Fix:** Migrate to MVVM with ViewModels and UseCases
2. **No dependency injection:** Manual instantiation everywhere
   - **Fix:** Add Hilt
3. **No database:** Reading directly from ContentProvider
   - **Fix:** Add Room for local caching and threading
4. **No repository pattern:** Activities directly call ContentResolver
   - **Fix:** Add data layer with repositories
5. **Basic error handling:** Many operations silently fail
   - **Fix:** Proper error states and user feedback
6. **No testing:** Zero unit tests or integration tests
   - **Fix:** Add test coverage as per PRD requirements

### Performance Issues
1. **Large thread loading:** Loads all messages at once, no pagination
2. **Contact resolution:** Synchronous queries block UI
3. **No caching:** Repeated ContentProvider queries
4. **Image loading:** Contact photos loaded repeatedly

- ‚úÖ Send and receive SMS reliably
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Handle MMS (Not started)
- ‚úÖ Display conversations with contacts
- ‚úÖ Work with dual SIM
- ‚úÖ Be set as default SMS app
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Provide complete notification experience (70% done)

**Status:** 75% complete. Core SMS works well. MMS and some notification features needed.

### Long-Term Goal (Phase 1-7)
Add privacy-first security layer on top:
- ‚ùå Link analysis (Phase 1)
- ‚ùå Risk detection (Phase 1)
- ‚ùå Security UI (Phase 2)
- ‚ùå Trash vault (Phase 3)
- ‚ùå All other security features

**Status:** 0% complete. Phase 0 must be finished first per PRD.

## üí° Key Learnings & Decisions

### What Went Well
1. **Compose-first approach:** Clean, modern UI with minimal code
2. **DataStore for preferences:** Type-safe, reactive settings
3. **Multi-SIM support:** Robust implementation working well
4. **Contact integration:** Seamless name/photo resolution
5. **Search functionality:** Fast and comprehensive

### What Needs Improvement
1. **Architecture:** Need MVVM + DI for better separation
2. **Error handling:** Too many silent failures
3. **Performance:** No pagination or caching strategy
4. **Testing:** Zero test coverage currently
5. **MMS:** Should have prioritized earlier

### Design Decisions
1. **No Room database yet:** Using ContentProvider directly
   - Pro: Simpler to start
   - Con: No offline caching, harder to implement threading logic
   - Decision: Add Room after Phase 0 basics work

2. **DataStore instead of SharedPreferences:** Modern, type-safe
   - Pro: Reactive, coroutine-based
   - Con: More boilerplate
   - Decision: Worth it for maintainability

3. **Activity-based navigation:** No Navigation Component
   - Pro: Simple, straightforward
   - Con: Harder to test, more boilerplate
   - Decision: Sufficient for v1, may add later

4. **Full-screen default app gate:** No "Skip" option
   - Pro: Ensures proper functionality
   - Con: Slightly aggressive UX
   - Decision: Correct choice - app needs SMS permissions

4. **Add message status** (sent/delivered/failed indicators)
5. **Refactor to MVVM** (prepare for Phase 1 complexity)
6. **Add Room database** (enable better threading and caching)
7. **Start Phase 1** (security layer)

### Quick Start Commands
